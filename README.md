CyberOps by Zilith
This is a web-based, interactive tool designed to simulate various cybersecurity and network-related commands. It's intended for educational purposes, allowing users to explore the functionality of common command-line utilities in a safe, sandboxed environment.

Features
Simulated Commands: Explore the output of a range of commands, including ping, nslookup, nmap, and ipconfig.

Universal & OS-Specific: Use tools that work across all operating systems as well as commands specific to Windows (ipconfig, tracert) and Linux/macOS (ifconfig, traceroute).

Simple Interface: A clean, easy-to-use interface with buttons for each command and a dynamic output terminal.

Theme Toggle: Switch between a light and dark theme for comfortable viewing.

Getting Started
To use the tool, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. No installation or special setup is required.

How to Use
Enter a Target: In the input field at the top, enter a domain name (e.g., google.com) or an IP address. Some commands do not require a target.

Run a Command: Click on any of the buttons to see the simulated output in the terminal window below.

Clear Output: Use the "Clear" button to empty the terminal window.

Purpose
This project was created to provide a basic, hands-on introduction to some of the tools used in cybersecurity and network administration. It's a risk-free way to learn what these commands do and what their output looks like without needing to set up a complex lab environment.
