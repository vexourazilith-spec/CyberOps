🚧 Project Status
This project is an educational tool and should not be used for real-world network analysis. The command outputs are simulated to provide a safe, risk-free environment for learning.

Purpose
This project was created to provide a basic, hands-on introduction to some of the tools used in cybersecurity and network administration. It's a risk-free way to learn what these commands do and what their output looks like without needing to set up a complex lab environment.
